# MZTwins-vQTL
<br>

This repository contains two scripts to help analysts run the MZ-differences GWAS.
<br>
The GWAS will use PLINK binary format files (.bed, .bim, .fam).

<br>
1) The R script can be used to generate the phenotypes required for the 4 GWAS models. Details on input files in the R script.
<br>
2) The MZ_GWAS script contains PLINK code for each of the 4 GWAS models using the phenotype files derived in 1).
<br>
<br>

Note that these scripts are not fully automated so will require some tweaking, mostly to file paths and column numbers!
<br>
<br>

The analysis plan and details on selecting phenotypes can be found [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/lh14833_bristol_ac_uk/ETjDr5gvZMBPpnV0WSAcTS8BatLUpd4jYM81vaq9l48-Qw).
