# MZTwins-vQTL
<br>

This repository contains two scripts to help analysts run the MZ-differences GWAS.
<br>
The GWAS will use PLINK binary format files (.bed, .bim, .fam).

<br>
1) The R script can be used to generate the phenotypes required for the 4 GWAS models. Details on input files in the R script.
<br>
2) The MZ_GWAS script contains PLINK code for each of the 4 GWAS models using the phenotype files derived in 1).
<br>
3) the analysis plan and details on selecting phenotypes can be found [here](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/lh14833_bristol_ac_uk/Ef8oLfGUFO9JnKIxxQruq18BT9dRD5-6jg3zKbac7hiQaw?e=lRHnVp)

<br>
<br>
Note that these scripts are not fully automated so will require some tweaking, mostly to file paths and column numbers!
